# DayPlanner README

Welcome to the online Work Day Planner!


This site allows users to keep track of their work day schedule (9am-5pm)

There is no installation needed to use this website, just simply click on this link - https://alexh3422.github.io/DayPlanner/

To use the work day planner, simply: 

- scroll down to the time where you would like to add something to your schedule
- click on the open space between the time slot you chose, and the blue save button on the right 
      (note this space will change colors depending on time of day (Red = CURRENT HOUR OF DAY , Green = FUTURE HOUR OF DAY, Gray = PAST HOUR OF DAY)
- Once you clicked in the time slot's space you chose, simply type what you would like to add to your schedule and then click the blue save button to the     right. DONE! it will be saved for you to reference throughout the day. 




A COUPLE OF NOTES!!! 

This website will only save your schedule LOCALLY!!! Meaning that you can only access your saved schedule on the SAME device you used to enter your schedule on the website and you can not view your saved schedule on multiple devices.

This also means that should you clear your internet browsers local storage (normally known as CACHE), you will lose your saved data. 

This is a DAY planner. As soon as the clock strikes midnight (12AM), the webpage will automatically reset to the new current day's schedule and all of the previous stored schedule information will be removed
